## Decisions
Decisions will be made through a majority consensus with partial compromise. This means that while the group will aim to reach a decision that most members agree on, there may be some level of compromise involved to accommodate differing perspectives.
## Attendance
For attendance, the expectation is for members to attend meetings regularly. Legitimate reasons for missing meetings include emergencies, illness, or prior commitments. Members who miss meetings are responsible for catching up on any missed information or tasks discussed during the meeting.
## Assignments
Assignments will be made by splitting tasks among group members, with assignments being claimed on a first-come, first-serve basis. Members who do not complete assignments or do so poorly will be responsible for addressing the issue and may be asked to seek help if needed.
## Participation
Communication and sharing of information will primarily occur through a text group chat and during meetings. All members will be encouraged to participate fully, and tasks will be assigned based on individual interests and strengths to ensure everyone's involvement.
## Meeting Times and Locations
Meeting times will be decided based on the availability of all members, with a suggested time of 1:00 PM on Fridays via Zoom.
## Agenda and Minutes
Jeshua will be designated as the notetaker, and meeting agendas and minutes/notes will be shared with all members after each meeting.
## Promptness
Lateness to meetings is acceptable if communicated beforehand, but punctuality is encouraged to ensure productive use of everyone's time.
## Conversational Courtesies
Conversational courtesies will be encouraged, including active listening, sharing of airtime, avoiding tangents, and maintaining respectful dialogue. All members will be expected to respect each other's opinions and provide equal opportunity for everyone to speak.
## Enforcement
Enforcement of team rules will involve open conversation followed by necessary actions, with oversight from the Chief Technology Officer (CTO). If a team member consistently fails to adhere to the established guidelines or fulfill their responsibilities, the matter will be addressed through a conversation to understand the underlying issues and find potential solutions. If necessary, the CTO may intervene to provide guidance or implement consequences to ensure accountability and maintain team effectiveness.
## Feedback
Feedback preferences among individuals will be respected, with consideration given to how each member prefers to give and receive feedback. Some may prefer direct and constructive feedback, while others may prefer a more collaborative or gentle approach. Understanding and respecting these preferences will contribute to a positive and supportive team environment where feedback can be effectively communicated and received.
